## Project Details
>This project is an experimental study on real-time heart-rate monitoring using a camera's remote photoplethysmography(rPPG). 

In this project we tried to find the real-time heart rate of people through the camera. There are many algorithms existing for rPPG based on data-driven or meta learning approaches. But they require high computing power. So to solve this problem we extended the *Eulerial Video Magnification Algorithm* to find the heart rate. It's much more efficient. Here is our algorithm skeleton.
